# Web Design (Picasso)
[Link to Class](https://codehs.com/course/web_design_picasso/overview)  
&nbsp;  
This is a course on basic web development, introducing HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. All files in this repository are webpages I created while taking this course.
Each unit folder contains a guide to what material was covered. Not all units had me create webpages, which is why there is not a folder for them.  
&nbsp;  
Units:
1. Getting Started - What is the Web?
2. HTML - Structuring Websites
3. CSS - Styling Websites
4. Homepage: Your First Website
5. Advanced HTML and CSS
6. Project: Tell a Story **(In progress)**
&nbsp;

Was there a better way to format all these files? Most definitely.  
Will I reformat these files? No. Let this be a testament to my first real repository.  
(I swear I'm not a vibe coder)
